## Laptop
A [_laptop_][laptoplink] computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC).

[_Laptop_][laptoplink]s typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid.

#### Types of laptops

##### Smaller and larger laptops  
>There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller and larger laptop computers; these included "notebook" and "subnotebook" models, low cost "netbooks", and "ultra-mobile PCs" where the size class overlapped with devices like smartphone and handheld tablets, and "Desktop replacement" laptops for machines notably larger and heavier than typical to operate more powerful processors or graphics hardware...  
##### Convertible, hybrid, 2-in-1  
>The latest trend of technological convergence in the portable computer industry spawned a broad range of devices, which combined features of several previously separate device types. The hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a touchscreen display designed to allow users to work in a tablet mode, using either multi-touch gestures or a stylus/digital pen...  
##### Rugged laptop  
>A rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular laptops, and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.  

#### Laptop hardware
The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts.  
Traditionally they were miniaturized and adapted to mobile use, The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.
**The most important laptop hardware parts include a:**
1. Display
2. Central processing unit ([_CPU_][cpulink])
3. Graphics processing unit ([_GPU_][gpulink])
4. Memory
5. Internal storage
